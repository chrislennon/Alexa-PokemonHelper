## Development
This skill was built with the aid of the [ask-cli](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/smapi/quick-start-alexa-skills-kit-command-line-interface.html). This will assist with easier management of:
 - The linking of the skill to lambda
 - The models of the skill
 - The lambda code which acts as the worker for getting information and formatting a response.

 ## Notes
 - You may need to change elements of the skills.json to avoid conflicting names.
 - You can always use `ask init` to have a fresh skill setup for you and then copy over the required source from this project.
